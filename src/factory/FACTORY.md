# Factory Method
Factory Method is used to create class. 

When "new" is to be used, factory method should be considered.

The advantage is that it makes the creation more dynamic. 

[It is usually used with interface, abstract class or anonymous class](https://github.com/Teleology/ts-design/blob/master/src/strategy/strategy.ts)
